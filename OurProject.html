      <strong>Abstract:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Public uncertainty about elections has increased over the last few years, leading to distrust of election outcomes. Microsoft ElectionGuard aims to make elections end-to-end verifiable, which allows secure confirmation of votes. Our product is a website template for use by 3rd parties to host an election record with a confirmation code for each ballot. Users can use these sites to verify that their vote has been counted correctly, while keeping their actual vote confidential. This contributes to ElectionGuard’s goal of making the voting process more secure and transparent, allowing voters to have greater trust in election results.</p>

      <strong>Target Stakeholders & Users</strong>
    </p>
    <p>At the start of this project we discussed who our stakeholders were and how would they benefit from this project. We wanted to identify as many possible stakeholders as possible, however we were limited by time restraints. Although we were not able to engage with stakeholders, we focused a wide breadth approach. Implementing a uniform user interface, avoiding confusing forms, unaligned elements and irrelevant images.</p>
