            <p>This page contains some of the most common questions regarding the ElectionGuard software and how elections work when ElectionGuard is implemented.
            </p>
            <h3>Q: Can I check who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>No.
                </b> The site will only display whether your vote was correctly tallied in the election.
            </p>
            <p>For privacy purposes, actual votes have no way of being displayed after they have been cast.
            </p>
            <h3>Q: Can others see who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>No.
                </b> No one, including the person who submitted their cast ballot can see the contents after it has been cast.
            </p>
            <h3>Q: Is my name attached to the verification code feature?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>No.
                </b> Verification codes are anonymous and encrypted. Names are never displayed on confirmation codes.
            </p>
            <h3>Q: What does my ballot status mean?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Cast
                </b> - This status means that your ballot was received and is part of the election record
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Spoiled
                </b> - This status indicates that this ballot was not cast, the ballot was spoiled, and the contents of the ballot are available to be seen
            </p>
            <h3>Q: Can someone find out who I am from a spoiled ballot?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>All
                </b> ballots whether they are cast or spoiled do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and are fully encrypted.
