    <p>This page contains some of the most common questions regarding the ElectionGuard software and how elections work when ElectionGuard is implemented.</p>
    </pre>
    <p><b>Can I check who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?</b></p>
    <p><b>No.</b> The site will only display whether your vote was correctly tallied in the election. For privacy purposes, actual votes have no way of being displayed after they have been cast.</p>
    <p><b>Can others see who I voted for in my officially casted ballot?</b></p>
    <p><b>No.</b> No one, including the person who submitted their cast ballot can see the contents after it has been cast.</p>
    <p><b>Is my name attached to the verification code feature?</b></p>
    <p><b>No.</b> Verification codes are anonymous and encrypted. Names are never displayed on confirmation codes.</p>
    <p><b>What does my ballot status mean?</b></p>
    <p><b>Cast</b> - This status means that your ballot was received and is part of the election record</p>
    <p><b>Spoiled</b> - This status indicates that this ballot was not cast, the ballot was spoiled, and the contents of the ballot are available to be seen</p>
    <p><b>Can someone find out who I am from a spoiled ballot?</b></p>
    <p><b>Absolutely Not.</b> All ballots whether they are cast or spoiled do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and are fully encrypted.</p>
